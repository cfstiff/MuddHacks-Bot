This is the code for our Fall 2016 Muddhacks project, Sleep Dep Buddy. Our project is a small desktop pet, which uses light sensors to go to sleep when the lights are off. If the owner isn't sleeping enough, the pet will slowly lose health, and then regain health when the owner starts sleeping more. 
The project was based on a kickstarted Arduino board called Pixel. It uses the Adafruit graphics libraries, with some modification (which is why they are included here).
As this was a hackathon project, the code is quite messy - but we have maintained it as is until we can return to it.
Our project won 2nd place in the competition.
